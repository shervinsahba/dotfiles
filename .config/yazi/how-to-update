The config advice on yazi's docs [1] says to copy the config files from github [2]. I don't seem to be able to find example configs under system directories, so I guess just check the github. There are three files

- keymap.toml
- theme.toml
- yazi.toml

The last time I pulled from the github was on 2023-12-04.
